Create dataset:
- Collect websites to be scraped
- Scrape paintings of all kinds (may filter later)
- Paintings must be sorted by culture/geography while scraping, and time period (could have seperate folders for these)

Create AI:
- Research Q1:
  - Probably will need a LLM fine-tuned on image analysis
  - Further fine-tune LLM on our dataset (art is input, corresponding analysis is target output)
  - On fine-tuned LLM, pass in a filtered dataset (i.e. images about the Christian concept of god), and get the generated analysis of each painting as output
  - Maybe pass output analysis into a seperate model, that could measure things like sentiment, to analyze how the depictions of a concept have changed over time
